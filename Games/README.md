# 🎮 Terminal-Based C Games by Team Elite

Welcome to the **Games** folder of my C programming projects.  
Here you’ll find a set of classic games written in C language using basic concepts like arrays, loops, conditions, and structures. These games run directly in the terminal and are designed to be simple, fun, and a great way to strengthen logic building.

## 📂 Games Included

### 🧠 Card Matching Game (`CardMatching.c`)
- Flip and match pairs from a hidden grid
- Tests your memory and pattern recognition

### ✊🖐✌️ Rock Paper Scissors (`RockPaperSession.c`)
- A simple player vs computer game
- Random moves and scoring logic

### 🐍 Snake Game (`Snackgame.c`)
- Terminal version of the classic snake game
- Eat food to grow longer without hitting walls

### ❌⭕ Tic Tac Toe (`TicTakToe.c`)
- Two-player game played on a 3x3 board
- Implements win check logic for rows, columns, and diagonals

### 🌀 Maze Game (`mazegame.c`)
- Solve a maze by navigating using key input
- Dynamic layout and challenge logic

### 🧩 Main Menu (`main.c`)
- Acts as the launcher or central menu to select which game to play (if implemented)
- Handles user interaction and navigation between games

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Structuring code using functions and modular design
- Applying loops and conditions for game flow
- Using random number generation for unpredictable game behavior
- Creating interactive experiences in a text-based terminal
- Handling user input effectively

## 🛠 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```

git clone [https://github.com/hackeranshu007/projects.git](https://github.com/hackeranshu007/projects.git)
cd projects/Games

```

2. Compile any game using GCC:
```

gcc CardMatching.c -o cardmatch
./cardmatch

```

3. Or compile the main menu if available:
```

gcc main.c -o games
./games

```

> You may need to compile with additional `.c` files if `main.c` connects to others. Update include paths accordingly.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

- Integrating all games under one main menu
- Adding score tracking and difficulty levels
- Improving terminal UI with box drawing and color codes
- Adding input handling using arrow keys

Let me know if you want to:

* Add screenshots or sample outputs
* Add `.gif` demos or gameplay instructions
* Turn `main.c` into a full menu launcher (if it’s not already)

I can also create one unified launcher for all games if you plan to go that route.
