# 🎮 C Language Game Projects by Team Elite

Welcome to the **C Games Repository** by **Team Elite**.  
This collection includes fun and interactive terminal-based games made using pure C programming. Each project helped us practice **logic building**, **structures**, **loops**, **arrays**, and other core C concepts.
