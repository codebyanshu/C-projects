# 🔧 C Programming Projects by Team Elite

Welcome to our collection of **C language projects**, built and maintained by **Team Elite**!  
This repository features a variety of **terminal-based C programs** created to learn, practice, and master core C programming concepts such as **loops, conditions, arrays, pointers, structures, and file handling**.

## 📂 Project Categories

### 🎮 Mini Games
- **Number Guessing Game** – Guess the randomly generated number.
- **Card Matching Game** – Flip cards and find matching pairs.
- **Snake Game** *(coming soon)* – Classic terminal-based snake game.
- **Minesweeper** – Avoid hidden mines while uncovering safe spots.
- **Maze Game** – Find your way through a randomly generated maze.

### 🎫 Utility Programs
- **Ticket Booking System** – Book seats, view bookings, cancel tickets.
- **Library Management System** *(coming soon)* – Add, issue, and manage books.
- **Student Record System** – Store and retrieve student details using files.
- **Encryption-Decryption Tool** – Basic text security with file handling.

## 💡 What We Learned

- Control flow with loops and conditions  
- Structuring code using functions and structures
