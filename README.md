## 🏦 Bank Management System

A terminal-based banking simulation with features like:

- Secure login
- Account creation
- Loan services
- Deposit and withdrawal
- Account sorting
- Data encryption

**How to run:**

```sh
cd "Bank Managment System"
gcc main.c -o bank -std=c99
./bank
```

---

## 🎮 Games

Classic games implemented in C:

- **Card Matching Game** (`CardMatching.c`)
- **Rock Paper Scissors** (`RockPaperSessior.c`)
- **Snake Game** (`Snackgame.c`)
- **Tic Tac Toe** (`TicTakToe.c`)
- **Maze Game** (`mazegame.c`)
- **Mining Game** (`MiningGame.c`)
- **Games Main Menu** (`main.c`)

**How to run a game:**

```sh
cd Games
gcc CardMatching.c -o cardmatch
./cardmatch
```

Or run the main menu:

```sh
gcc main.c -o games
./games
```

## 🏥 Hospital Management System

Manage hospital operations:

- Patient records
- Billing
- Login and welcome screens

**How to run:**

```sh
cd "Hospital Management System"
gcc main.c -o hospital
./hospital
```

---

## 💻 Virtual Machine

A simple virtual machine project for simulating instructions and testing code execution.

- **main.c / main2.c**: Core VM logic and alternate entry point.
- **test.tim**: Example/test file for VM input.

**How to run:**

```sh
cd "Virtual Machine"
gcc main.c -o vm
./vm
```
